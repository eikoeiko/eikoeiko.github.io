        My first large project was my film persona, expressed through my YouTube channel. I have been uploading since 2015. <br> <br>
        In the winter of 2016, me some teenage peers co-founded a website service with called Developster.io. Developster's goal was to bring together teenagers who were making things
         and help them collaborate and upskill <br> In the summer of 2017, Developster became unsustainable and shut down, but remains a massive learning experience, and a good use of my school's student fund. <br> <br> I now works 
        as a freelance graphic designer, focussing on web, apps, and brands. Photographs, films, clothing and marketing are my main artistic focus today.<br> <br>
