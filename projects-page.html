        Eiko's first large project was his film persona, expressed through his YouTube channel. He has been uploading since 2015. <br> <br>
        In the winter of 2016, Eiko co-founded a website service with friends called Developster.io. The goal was to connect 
        creative teenagers worldwide and help them collaborate and build their skillset. <br> In the summer of 2017, Developster became unsustainable and shut down, but remains a massive learning experience, and a substantial use of his school's student fund. <br> <br> Eiko now works 
        as a freelance graphic designer, focussing on web, apps, and brands. Photographs, films, clothing and marketing are his main artistic focus today.<br> <br><i>Eiko wrote his biography in the third person, so as to appear more esteemed.</i>
